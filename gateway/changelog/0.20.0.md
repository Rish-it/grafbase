## Features

- Pathfinder, the GraphQL query tool in Grafbase's dashboard, can now show the query plan and the trace for an operation. It relies on a new default behavior of the Grafbase gateway that exposes it whenever `x-grafbase-telemetry` request header is present. Further details can be found in the [configuration documentation](https://grafbase.com/docs/self-hosted-gateway/telemetry#exposing-the-query-plan-and-trace-id-in-the-response).
