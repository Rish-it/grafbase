- Support specifying access log rotate size as a string with a unit such as:

```toml
[gateway.access_logs]
enabled = true
path = "./logs"
rotate.size = "200MiB"
```

- Subgraph requests now use the `Accept: application/graphql-response+json; charset=utf-8, application/json; charset=utf-8` header instead of `Accept: application/json`, following the [Graphql-over-HTTP spec recommendation](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/blob/main/spec/GraphQLOverHTTP.md#legacy-watershed).
