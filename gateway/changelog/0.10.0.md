### Features

- We added a bunch of new metrics to the gateway. ([docs](https://website-git-gb-7293-new-metrics-docs.grafbase-vercel.dev/docs/self-hosted-gateway/telemetry#metrics))

### Fixes

- Using `--log=trace` would panic.
- Gateway configuration defaults were not consistently applied. When not providing any TOML configuration path, it led `request_body_limit` to have a default value of `0` refusing all requests.
- `@join__field` is now optional for non-federated types: no `@join__type` directive with a `key` argument.
