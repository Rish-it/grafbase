## Features

- Better logs with pretty formatting by default in the terminal. It can be forced with `--log-style pretty`, the previous format is available with `--log-style text`. Now when using `--log debug`, the executed subgraph query with variables and the response are shown.
- Custom access logs through WebAssembly hooks ([docs](https://website-git-gb-7341-access-logs.grafbase-vercel.dev/docs/self-hosted-gateway/hooks#access-logs-with-response-hooks)).
